PROJECT : 
        
                         ***********Inventory Management System using PYTHON and JSON****************

OBJECTIVES : 

        1.To build a simple and efficient program for Client side to make Purchases and simultaneously Update Inventory .
        
        2.To build a simple and efficient program for Admin side to Modify the Inventory. Modifications provided such as 
          Change Product Quantity, Change Product Price, ADD new Product in the Inventory, REMOVE existing Product from the 
          Inventory.
        
        3.To create a JSON file to store Inventory in the form of Dictionary to retrieve Products using Unique Product ID i.e.KEYS.
        
        4.To create a SALES file to store Customer's information such as Name, Phone No., Email ID along with their purchase details.
        
TECHNOLOGY USED : 
        
        1.PYTHON (File Handling, Functions, dictionary data Structure, If-Else Structure, Match Structure)
        
        2.JSON   (For storing Inventory)
        
        3.Txt File (For storing Sales Report)
        
        4.Jupyter Notebook
        
LEARNING GOALS :

        1.Understanding the File Handling mechanism in PYTHON
        
        2.Create an Inventory and make Modifications
        
        3.Understand JSON DUMPS and LOADS methods
        
        4.Also to get familiar with PYTHON and warmup for further complex possible challenges ahead
        
CONCLUSION : 

        Created first Project in the Learning path of Data Analytics and learned valuable lessons through hands-on PYTHON programming.
